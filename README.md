Web development refers to the creating, building, and maintaining of websites. It includes aspects such as web design, web publishing, web programming, and database management. It is the creation of an application that works over the internet i.e. websites.



It's been long since I started web dev and I made some games while I was learning the frontend part , those were the :-



- Dice Game 🎲

      Player 1 and Player 2 has each die .When the two die are rolled , the one 

      with the most number wins.

      

- Simon Game 🎮

       The device had four colored buttons, each producing a particular tone

       when it is pressed or activated by the device. A round in the game

       consists of the device lighting up one or more buttons in random order

       after which the player must reproduce that order by pressing the

       buttons . As the game progresses , the number of buttons to be pressed

       increases.



- Drum Kit 🥁

        Nothing you just have to play the drums .😂
